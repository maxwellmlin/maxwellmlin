I am an undergraduate researcher investigating the state of website compliance with current privacy laws. I also design, implement, and test autonomous underwater vehicles in the Duke Robotics Club. I have extensive experience in Python especially with the ROS and Selenium libraries. I also work in Java, JavaScript, and R.
